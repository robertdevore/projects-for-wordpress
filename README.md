## Usage

### Add a New Project

1. In the WordPressÂ® admin, go to **Projects â†’ Add New**.
2. Add your project title, description, and featured image.
3. Select a **Project Type**: Plugin, Theme, or Pattern.
4. In the sidebar, paste the GitHub Repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo`).
5. Publish.

### Enable Download Link

Each project automatically gets a unique download endpoint:

Example:  
`https://example.com/download/123`

This URL fetches the latest `.zip` release from GitHub and increments the download count.

## Settings Overview

Navigate to **Projects â†’ Settings** to configure:

### General Settings

- **GitHub API Token** â€“ Recommended for authenticated requests (avoids GitHub rate limits).
- **Telemetry** â€“ Toggle to help improve the plugin.

### Templates Settings

Enable/disable the following GitHub data in your project views:

- Version  
- Last Updated  
- License  
- Language  
- Downloads  
- Stars / Forks / Issues  
- GitHub Owner

### Archive Settings

Toggle components for the project archive view:

- Archive Title  
- Project Title  
- Project Excerpt  
- Project Buttons

## Connect Your GitHub Repo

To connect a project to GitHub:

1. Paste the full repo URL into the **GitHub URL** field when editing a Project.
2. Make sure your GitHub repo has a release with a `.zip` asset or a valid `zipball_url`.

### Optional: Add a GitHub API Token

To avoid hitting rate limits or improve reliability:

1. Go to GitHub â†’ **Settings â†’ Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens**.
2. Generate a token (no scopes required).
3. Paste it into the settings screen under **GitHub API Token**.

## How to Zip the Plugin for GitHub Releases

When attaching the plugin to a GitHub release:

1. Zip **only the contents of the plugin folder**, not the parent folder.
2. Ensure `projects-for-wordpress.php` and `/includes`, `/admin`, `/templates`, `/assets` are at the root level of the ZIP.
3. Name the ZIP clearly (e.g. `projects-for-wordpress-1.0.0.zip`).
4. Go to your GitHub repo â†’ **Releases** â†’ **New Release**.
5. Tag the release with the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`).
6. Upload your correctly structured ZIP as a release asset.

Your users will be redirected to this file when they use the `/download/` endpoint.

## REST API Endpoints

### All Projects

```http
GET /wp-json/projects/v1/projects
```

Supports optional query params:

- `page`
- `per_page`

### Popular Projects
    
```http
GET /wp-json/projects/v1/popular
```

Returns the most downloaded projects.

## Template Integration

You can override the plugin templates in your theme:

- `single-projects.php`
- `archive-projects.php`
- `taxonomy-project-type.php`

Just copy the templates from the plugin's `/templates/` folder into your theme's root and customize.

## Social Sharing Buttons

Each project includes social sharing links for:

- Facebook
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Pinterest
- WhatsApp
- Email

## Developer Notes

- All public-facing code is translation-ready.
- Full support for Full Site Editing (FSE) and Classic themes.
- REST API ready and easily extendable.
- Clean separation of concerns: CPT/taxonomy, settings, metaboxes, API, styling.
